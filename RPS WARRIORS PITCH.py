#The game that me and my group came up with is RPS WARRIORS. This is a rock paper scissors game with multiple game modes like Story mode, Battle mode,Friend battle, and an item shop.The Battle mode will have a lobby
#We will also have a multi-changing item shop where you can buy multiple different weapons and power ups from the Item shop. There is also
#a locker where your items are once you buy it.


#For friend and battle mode there will be two different types of lobbies. For friend battles, it will be a lobby that you spawn into with friends and just 1v1. For
#battle mode you will have the option to invite up to 3 other players you will be the fourth. You will have the option to play duos, trios, or squads and fight against other groups, but you will still be able to
#Do one on one battle.


#For story mode you will have a set of levels to play against a robot to complete the story. You will play as Azarashi, a normal boy who lives at the farm with his mom he decides to leave his farm to become an RPS warrior while traveling he ends up in a cemetery 
#all this would be done using rock paper scissors. It's usually the game but the difference is that the story mode will be totally different from the online mode.
#There even is a area pin to it so your only playing against people in your area.
